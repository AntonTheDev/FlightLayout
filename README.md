##Introduction

SwiftLayout is a simple framework, functionally between the manual process of laying out views, and Autolayout's magical ways, with minimal developer effort. The motivation for this framework is to introduce a comparable, easily readable, and concise approach to laying out views. The goal was to eliminate the mental math of the old days, AutoLayout's overheader, and lack of support for animating constrains with CoreAnimation.
